# SMART-MATH-AI-POWERED-MATH-SOLVER
Smart Math: AI Powered Math Solver is an advanced tool
that integrates Computer Vision and Generative AI to
simplify mathematical problem-solving. Users can draw
mathematical expressions on the screen, with real-time
gesture recognition powered by MediaPipe and seamless
interaction through Streamlit. Leveraging OpenCV for
visual processing and Google Gemini AI for accurate
solutions, this project offers an intuitive, efficient, and
precise approach to complex calculations, redefining how
users interact with digital math-solving tools.
